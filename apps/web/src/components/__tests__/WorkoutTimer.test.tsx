/*
Expected WorkoutTimer Behavior:

1. When rendered without progressiveWorkout prop:
   - Should calculate progressive workout internally using calculateProgressiveWorkout
   - Should display exercises with their credit rewards
   - Should show timer for each exercise

2. When rendered with progressiveWorkout prop:
   - Should use the provided progressive workout instead of calculating one
   - Should display the exercises from the provided workout
   - Should show correct credit rewards

3. When workout is completed:
   - Should call onComplete with:
     - credits: number (sum of exercise creditReward + random bonus)
     - workoutMeta: object containing exercises, totalDuration, difficulty
   - Should show completion screen with earned credits

4. Credit calculation:
   - Base credits = sum of all exercise creditReward values
   - Bonus credits = random number between 0-19
   - Total credits = base credits + bonus credits

Example expected onComplete call:
onComplete(25, {
  exercises: [
    { name: 'Push-ups', creditReward: 10, ... },
    { name: 'Squats', creditReward: 10, ... }
  ],
  totalDuration: 65,
  difficulty: 1
})

The credits issue in the dashboard is likely caused by:
1. Missing progressiveWorkout prop being passed from Dashboard
2. WorkoutMeta not being properly structured when passed to handleCompleteWorkout
3. Credits not being properly calculated or passed through the completion flow
